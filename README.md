# Predicting Future Changes in a Publicly Traded Stock Using Historical Data and Methods from Probability

My IB Mathematics Analysis and Approaches HL Internal Assessment. 

> **Abstract**:
> In this paper, I employ Markov Chains on a frequency distribution of historical three-day trading

Don't be fooled by the title! This isn't actually a good idea in practice; but, the
usage and applications of concepts that I learned in my mathematics course is the
real value of this article. The process of writing this as my first Internal 
Assessment towards my IB Diploma Candidacy was truly remarkable and I am grateful
I have the opportunity to do higher level work that most students don't get to 
do in high school.
